# Dollars Not Data

Welcome Dollars Not Data! Below you can find a list of services and
applications that value you privacy. Instead of using your personal
data in order to make those services sustainable, you pay for them instead.

Some of these services might be useable without paying and some don't
accept money at all, however, we encourage you to pay or donate.
